This project is a real-time cryptocurrency dashboard built with Python and Streamlit. It extracts crypto market data using an ETL pipeline, processes it with pandas, and visualizes key metrics in an interactive dashboard.

Features included:

Market summary: Total market cap and total volume

Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap

Price summary: average, highest, and lowest prices

Market cap and current price charts

Volume summary and chart

Price trends of top cryptocurrencies over time

The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of the crypto market and is ready for further enhancements like 24h gainers/losers and auto-refresh updates.
